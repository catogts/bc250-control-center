"""Whether Prepare dependencies left Bazzite waiting for a reboot.

On Bazzite the host packages are layered with ``rpm-ostree install``: they
land in a new deployment that only becomes the running system after a
reboot, and the parts that build on them (fan PWM, verification) are left
for a second preparation after that reboot.

Read-only. The answer is yes only when the deployment waiting for the next
boot requests one of the packages Prepare dependencies layers and the running
deployment does not: an automatic Bazzite update staged in the background
carries the same layered packages over, so it never reads as pending setup.
