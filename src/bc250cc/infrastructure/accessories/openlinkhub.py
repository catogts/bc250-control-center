"""Corsair hubs, AIOs, fans and RGB through OpenLinkHub.

Corsair controls its hubs only from iCUE on Windows. OpenLinkHub replaces it
on Linux: a small service that owns the USB devices and serves a control panel
at http://127.0.0.1:27003. NexGen3D's Steam Machine PRO case wires its fans and
lighting to a Corsair Commander Duo, which is what brought it here.

The upstream release ships three ways in. Its .rpm installs into /opt and
creates a system user from inside the package scripts, which rpm-ostree does
not handle well, so every distribution takes the user-space archive instead:
the program in the user's tools folder, a user service, and the upstream udev
rule with its group. That route writes only to /etc and the home folder, so
it works the same on Arch, Fedora, Debian, Bazzite and SteamOS.

The steps follow upstream's install-user-space.sh, except that script also
runs ``chmod -x /etc/udev/rules.d/`` (it meant the rule file), which is not
repeated here.
