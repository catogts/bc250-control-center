"""Update this installation to the latest published release.

The dashboard already knows when a newer version exists (``release_check``).
This module does the rest: it reads that release from GitHub, picks the one
package that matches how this copy was installed, downloads it with the
checksum GitHub publishes for it, and builds the one command that installs
it. The command runs in the application's terminal like every other
privileged workflow, so the output and the exit status are the ones the user
already knows.

Authorization asks for a window first. A password typed into the terminal was
the only route, and on a board driven with a controller from the sofa nobody
typed it: sudo timed out twice and the update failed at 81 %. With a
graphical Polkit agent, pacman, dnf and APT run through ``pkexec``, and
rpm-ostree asks Polkit itself; the terminal password stays as the fallback.

The same rules as the version check, tightened for a file that gets
installed:

* **HTTPS only, one repository.** Redirects are followed only while they stay
  on https (GitHub hands downloads to its asset CDN).
* **Checksummed or refused.** A package is installed only when GitHub (or the
  release's ``SHA256SUMS.txt``) publishes its SHA-256, and only when the
  download matches it. The install command checks it again right before the
  package manager runs, so a file swapped in the cache meanwhile is refused.
* **The package manager decides.** pacman, dnf, rpm-ostree and APT install
  the package; nothing here copies files into place itself.
* **Never guess.** A development checkout or a release without a package for
  this system gets the release page instead of a best effort.
* **SteamOS too.** Its root is read-only, so the one authorization runs a
  small root script that switches the protection off, installs the package
  with pacman and switches it back on, whether pacman succeeded or not.
* **One package in the cache.** A verified download is reused by a retry
  instead of fetched again, every other file in the updates folder (older
  versions, a ``.part`` left by a crash) is removed before a download, and the
  package is deleted once it is installed.
